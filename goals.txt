Orbis is supposed to be a physics engine for particle simulation like sand and fluid simulation.


### Basic Goal 
1. Create some simple editor tools.
    1.1 A small text box at the left corner of the screen which shows the X and Y coordinate the Mouse is hovering over.
    1.2 A button to turn the XY coordinate on and off.

2. Create a config file and import Raylib there and import config file everywhere else.

3. Create a 2D Grid to start the simulation with.
